To setup:
* Create a [new conda environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
* Activate new conda environment
* Download requirements.txt file (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
* Download [DELPHI](https://github.com/lucian-ilie/DELPHI) & point its top directory to this one

To run simply jump right into the existing .ipynb notebooks. 
Either use the trained models in /final_models or train your own models with your own dataset by editing the dataset name and model save path in F3_Hit_Rate_Benchmarking.ipynb and hitting run.

The ER datafiles (if not present) will be generated upon the first run
